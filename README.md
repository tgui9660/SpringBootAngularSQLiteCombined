# Spring Boot Angular SQLite Deployment

This demo project is an effort to combine all features needed within a single Sprin Boot app to support light to mid tier web applications.

To do so the following are within this project:
* Angular frontend
* SQL Lite DB with persistence
* ORM via Hibernate
* Spring Boot as the executing container
